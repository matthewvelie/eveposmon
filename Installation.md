This document explains how to install eveposmon, the requirements and what to expect on your first run.



# Details #

EVEPOSMON requires:
  * Windows
  * .net 2+
  * An internet connection

To get eveposmon there are two options.
  1. Download the setup file from the website and run it.  It will automatically install .net 2 if needed
  1. Download the source from the svn on the website, compile it yourself (needs Visual C# 2005 or higher) and run it from there.

As an additional security feature, because you are using high security keys you can setup a proxy that will hold those keys, please see [API\_Proxy](API_Proxy.md) for more details on how to do that.

On install you want to goto utilities -> api keys.  Once you have selected your character information go utilities -> select starbases.  From there you can select the starbases you wish to monitor.
